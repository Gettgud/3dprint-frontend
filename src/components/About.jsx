            <p>
            NTCountryCreations is a small craft company with a specialty in 3D printing. 
            Nichelle Kelly, and I, Tim Beal, created the company in 2021. We love making 
            unique products for friends and family and we now plan to expand to a broader 
            audience.

            <h1 className="font-weight-light">History</h1>
            <p>
            I worked my first engineering co-op in January of 2018. One of my main jobs was 
            designing custom tool holders that would improve organization and ergonomics. These 
            tool holders would be printed by a very fancy and expensive industrial printer (EOS P 396 for those who care). 
            Using the printer was fun, however, I wasn’t allowed to print anything for myself. So I thought “Heck, I’ll just 
            buy my own desktop printer!” The next day, I ordered one for less than $1,000 on Amazon and I instantly fell in 
            love with it! It gave quick gratification and endless possibilities of products. All I had to do was find cool models online, 
            figure out the best way to print them, and then do it! Although this sounds like a perfect story, anyone with a 3D printer, or
            any kind of manufacturing device for that matter, will tell you there’s always trials and tribulations. It’s taking me years to 
            become the expert that I am now and I’m still learning everyday! Today, I have many 3D printers in my “maker’s space” and continue 
            to try new things and push the limits of these nifty devices. 
            I first met Nichelle in Summer of 2021 at an outdoor beach volleyball league at a local sports bar called 12 North. Within a month, 
            we were dating, and I shared my passion for 3D printing. To my delight, she loved my creations and she even shared her creations with me. Nichelle owns a Cricut device and is able to add custom designs to t-shirts, water bottles, wood, and much much more.

            I wanted to give a special thanks to my best friend Yancarlos Diaz, and his protege Carlos German, who made this website possible! Thank you so much! :D
